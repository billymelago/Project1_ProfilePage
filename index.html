        <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
          <p>I'm a graduate of The Art Institute of Pittsburgh. I graduated with an Associate Degree in Computer Animation and Multimedia. At the time of graduation however, I decided to pursue another dream...</p> 

         <span class="pjSite"><a href="http://www.girardpizzajoes.com" target="_blank">I bought a pizza shop!</a></span>
          
          <p>I have spent the past 14 years as an Owner/ Operator of local pizza shop. This unique opportunity has provided me with experience in many different areas.
              Providing excellent customer service and effective communication.
              Designing menus, direct mail pieces, posters and signs.
              Increasing sales through digital marketing and social media branding.</p>
          <p>I wanted a website for my shop so I started to learn how.  I had no idea how much I would enjoy it!</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>


        <p>After a successful yet mildly fulfilling run, I am ready to hang up my pizza cutter. I need to follow my bliss. 
        I must satisfy my creative drive as it keeps gnawing at me from the inside. 

         I am learning web design as well as web development on my own time through paid online courses. I just enrolled in the Techdegree program at TeamTreehouse and absolutley love it! I am still in the trenches at the pizza shop, but I am now on my journey to become a web designer and developer. I am really excited to start a new creative career!</p>
        <p>These are the skills I have now and want to focus on:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li class="adobeIllIcon"></li>    
          <li class="htmlIcon"></li>
          <li class="cssIcon"></li>
          <li class="javaScriptIcon"></li>
        </ul> <!-- skills -->
        <p>My experience owning and operating a small business has given me a discipline and skillset that will be an asset to a design and development team. I am avalible for small freelance projects and open to any offers to work in team enviroment making beautiful designs and building kick @#%! websites.</p>
